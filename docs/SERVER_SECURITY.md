# Server security

Ashapp v0.0.7 adds explicit security choices for Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 and Debian 12. These are administration features, separate from VPN protocols and application updates. Real-VPS provisioning, packet filtering and recovery remain unverified. Local tests replace privileged commands; the SSH-forward test uses local loopback and a fake SSH channel.

## Defaults and management

New setups/templates select **Protect SSH with Fail2ban** and **Configure firewall** by default. **Firewall protection is experimental:** an AmneziaVPN tunnel has been reported to stop connecting when enabled, and the cause remains unconfirmed. Disable and apply the firewall choice if VPN access fails; if SSH is unavailable, use the provider console for recovery. Existing serialized templates acquire neither automatically. Adding a network service behind an existing Ashapp firewall requires a reviewed allowlist refresh. **Automatic security updates**, **Disable password SSH login** and SSH-key generation default to off. Unselected setup choices preserve existing policy. Management changes can explicitly turn Ashapp settings on or off.

Use **Manage → Security → Run diagnostics** for the selected IP/SSH port. Unknown status is not healthy or simply off. Draft controls do not change the server until **Review and apply changes** is confirmed. Provider firewalls remain separate.

## SSH keys

Connect with a password or imported private key/passphrase. Generate a unique Ed25519 key per server or import a key in Manage. Ashapp installs only the public key remotely, verifies an independent key login and sudo, and saves the private key in the OS vault. An unavailable vault blocks key-only migration. Private-key fields use an explicit masked Paste action that preserves PEM newlines; the copy icon in Access is explicit. Template key generation makes a fresh key per setup; an explicitly imported key belongs in protected template answers only.

Disabling password login affects every user, including keyboard-interactive passwords. Root denial is separate and requires a verified non-root administrator. Unsupported conditional SSH policy requires manual review. Creating administrators must not implicitly reopen password authentication. Keep a protected recovery key and provider-console access.

## Preview and recovery

A read-only preview captures relevant file hashes and current ports; stale previews are rejected. Changes use a private pending record under `/var/lib/ashapp/security`, a 180-second rollback timer and `ashapp-security-recovery.service` for an interrupted reboot. A new authenticated SSH connection with sudo must confirm before the deadline. Timer/boot recovery waits for a contended security lock instead of abandoning the attempt.

Recovery restores only unchanged transaction files, with original modes. Concurrent edits retain the pending record for manual recovery instead of overwriting them. Inspect private recovery records and service logs through the hosting console if needed. Do not publish complete records/configurations. Dependency installation remains applied; this is not a full VPS rollback. Successful SSH confirmation does not prove every VPN/firewall path.

## Fail2ban

The dedicated `ashapp-sshd` jail uses journald, actual SSH ports, 5 failures within 10 minutes and a 15-minute ban. Existing jails remain unchanged. For a freshly installed package, Ashapp supersedes only its new default SSH jail to support journal-only images without auth.log. Enabling protection also enables normal persistent service startup, even when the daemon is already running; rollback restores its prior activity and enabled state. Masked, runtime-only or other nonstandard startup policy requires manual review rather than silent conversion. Disabling protection disables the Ashapp jail, preserving unrelated protection. Management lists/unbans addresses in this jail only.

Application checks verify parameters, journal matching and installed IPv4/IPv6 actions with temporary documentation-only addresses, preserving prior bans. This is not a real failed-login test. If your own address is banned, use the provider console or wait for expiry; the application cannot bypass SSH filtering.

## Firewall

Dedicated `ASHAPP-IN`/`ASHAPP-DKR` chains use iptables/ip6tables and no-flush table transactions, preserving foreign chains and base policies. Ports include the current SSH listener, existing public services and Docker publications. Existing explicit host rules retain precedence, so earlier allow rules and provider policy still affect exposure. Diagnostics report listeners rather than an Internet scan.

Docker filtering uses its iptables `DOCKER-USER` hook and original destination ports. Active external UFW/firewalld, restrictive existing INPUT base policies and unsupported Docker backends stop automatic setup for manual review. Disabling removes Ashapp chains/plugin only. Later service changes need a reviewed firewall refresh. Persistence uses netfilter-persistent without snapshotting dynamic Docker chains, plus an owned Docker ExecStartPost drop-in to reconcile once Docker is ready. Diagnostics require the relevant container hooks. All persistence helpers, units and drop-ins have ownership/hash checks. Forwarding, IPv6, reboot behavior and simultaneous AWG/VLESS traffic need disposable-VPS validation.

Port review includes fixed public bindings of stopped Docker containers, so a later normal start can use the reviewed port. Running containers use their actual allocated ports; unresolved random ports on stopped containers require starting them before enabling protection. Public Docker ports are preserved in both INPUT and the forwarding filter, including userland-proxy paths. Loopback-only private SOCKS5 publications are not added to public allows. If Docker inspection fails, disabling owned protection remains available with an explicit unknown-publication warning; enabling protection still requires a complete review.

After adding or changing a protocol through AmneziaVPN, use **Manage → Security → Refresh firewall ports**. This obtains a new preview and requires confirmation; it does not automatically trust future ports. The checkbox represents the saved Ashapp policy, while **Effective firewall protection** separately reports verified, drifted or unknown rules. A failed verification must not make enabled but broken protection impossible to disable. Provider filtering and successful VPN traffic require separate external checks.

## Automatic OS updates

Off by default. Enabling configures unattended-upgrades and APT timers, permits only distribution security origins and disables automatic reboot. Debian matching follows the release codename/security label rather than moving stable/oldstable suites. Effective APT policy is checked; conflicting higher-priority settings cause failure/recovery.

Disabling removes the Ashapp override, restoring external update policy, which may remain enabled; diagnostics show that effective state separately. Packages remain installed. This does not update pinned sing-box binaries or Docker images. A reboot-required signal does not establish that the next kernel has a working AmneziaWG DKMS module.

## Private SOCKS5

Public mode retains the previous Docker TCP publication and proxy username/password. SOCKS5 authentication is unencrypted; destination HTTPS does not encrypt that separate exchange.

Private mode requires stable Docker Engine 28.0.0 or newer and publishes `127.0.0.1:server-port`. [Older Docker releases can expose localhost publications to nearby hosts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/port-publishing/). On a proven fresh runtime environment, Ashapp detects **Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04**, verifies Docker's full repository-signing fingerprint, uses a scoped distribution-specific APT repository, and installs a supported stable Engine 28/29 package. Existing runtime packages, data or conflicting repository policy require manual review instead of replacement.

An existing daemon must already be running and compatible; Ashapp does not automatically restart, upgrade or replace a shared runtime. Version/policy checks also run before private container changes, start/restart, credential retrieval and tunnel creation. Unknown/prerelease versions are refused. Unsupported existing private services remain stoppable or explicitly replaceable with fresh public-mode credentials. Public SOCKS5 remains available.

Start the tunnel in Manage and use its displayed **127.0.0.1:local-port** and proxy credentials. The local listener is loopback-only, bounds concurrent forwards and closes with SSH. Keep Ashapp running. This is an SSH forward, not a VPN-only listener or integration with AmneziaVPN's server manager. Mode/credential replacement interrupts existing proxy connections. Stop tunnels before updating Ashapp.

## Installation ledger, diagnostics and owned reset

The root-private `/var/lib/ashapp/lifecycle/` ledger records a bounded allowlist of desired settings, action names and step results. It contains no passwords, keys, usernames, device names, exports or raw console output. Local recovery answers are separate OS-vault entries tied to the endpoint and installation run. Explicit resume verifies that plan before skipping completed work; a ledger alone is not proof that a service remains healthy.

Diagnostics inspect actual selected services, kernel data plane, SSH/ping policy, protection ownership/rules and listener ports. Results distinguish failure, warning and unknown state. They cannot prove the provider firewall permits traffic or refresh another application's cached credentials. SOCKS5 credentials changed on the server require refreshing/re-importing existing client profiles.

Remote reset has a fresh preview/digest and removes only positively identified app-owned components. Captured SSH/security baselines use staged confirmation and recovery; external edits and unknown baselines are preserved for manual review. Removing a VPN also revokes its clients and removes its protected server exports. Users, current passwords, installed/upgraded packages, Docker itself, external services and exported local files remain. Runtime forwarding may stay enabled while unrelated networks depend on it. Reset is not OS restoration, and cannot recover an old root password. Application uninstall is separate and never changes remote servers.

## Required validation

Before production reliance, test fresh/existing Ubuntu and Debian VPSs, custom SSH ports, both authentication methods, journal-only images, both IP families, existing firewall policy, Docker, dual-protocol traffic, repeated setup, concurrent manual edits and disconnect/reboot recovery. Validate native OS-vault/installer retention and macOS sandbox behavior on actual systems. Unit tests and successful builds do not replace those checks.
